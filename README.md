## From original repo

Over 80K reports of UFO sightings around the world, collected from 1906 - 2014! The underlying dataset was scraped, geolocated, and time standardized from the National UFO Reporting Center (NUFORC) database, and hosted [here](https://github.com/planetsig/ufo-reports) by Sigmond Axel. I performed further cleaning and web scraping from the [NUFORC database](http://www.nuforc.org/webreports.html) to enhance the final dataset.
